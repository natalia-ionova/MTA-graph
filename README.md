# MTA-graph
MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) Data Structure Graph Project

Implemented an undirected Graph using an adjacency list respresentation to organize the MTA's Subway Stations. 
Used the General Transit Feed Specification data available at MTA's website: http://web.mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html#data. 
Used the transfers file that listed what stations are transfers.
Transfers file contains a stop ID that identifies a stop or station where a connection between routes begins.
and stop ID that identifies a stop or station where a connection between routes ends.
