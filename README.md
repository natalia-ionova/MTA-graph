# MTA-graph
MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) Data Structure Graph Project
<br />

Implemented an undirected Graph using an adjacency list respresentation to organize the MTA's Subway Stations <br />
Used the General Transit Feed Specification data available at MTA's website: http://web.mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html#data<br /> 
Used the transfers file that listed what stations are transfers <br />
Transfers file contains a stop ID that identifies a stop or station where a connection between routes begins <br />
and stop ID that identifies a stop or station where a connection between routes ends <br />
